# 🧮 Kotlin Calculator

A clean, modern calculator application built natively for Android using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. This project showcases a functional UI with basic arithmetic operations and a sleek dark theme interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`×`), Division (`÷`)
- **Clean UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative Android interface
- **Dark Theme**: Easy-on-the-eyes dark color scheme
- **Error Handling**: Graceful management of invalid operations (like division by zero)
- **Kotlin-Centric**: Written entirely in Kotlin, following modern Android development practices

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Language**: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 100%
- **UI Toolkit**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL (`*.gradle.kts` files)
- **Architecture**: Based on standard Android project structure
